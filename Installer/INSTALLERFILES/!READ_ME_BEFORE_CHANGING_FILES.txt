If you want to change the .bmp files here to customize the installer's look, feel free to!  
That said, you do need to do this carefully!

The images must retain the same names, file formats, and resolutions.
Modifying any of these properties of the .bmp files will result in the the installer
breaking when ran on monitors with a certain DPI.  This is incredibly hard to catch in testing,
so please be very, very careful if you choose to do this!
